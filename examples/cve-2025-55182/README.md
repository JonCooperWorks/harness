# CVE-2025-55182 Exploit Plugin

A harness plugin that exploits CVE-2025-55182, a Next.js and React.js vulnerability involving prototype pollution and command injection.

## Building

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
```

The compiled WASM will be at: `target/wasm32-wasip1/release/cve_2025_55182_plugin.wasm`

## Encrypting, Signing, and Running

```bash
# First, encrypt the plugin (Exploit Owner)
./bin/encrypt \
  -plugin examples/cve-2025-55182/target/wasm32-wasip1/release/cve_2025_55182_plugin.wasm \
  -type wasm \
  -harness-key harness_public.pem \
  -target-key target_public.pem \
  -exploit-keystore-key "exploit-key" \
  -output cve-2025-55182.encrypted

# Then, sign with execution arguments (Target)
./bin/sign \
  -file cve-2025-55182.encrypted \
  -target-keystore-key "target-key" \
  -exploit-key exploit_public.pem \
  -harness-key harness_public.pem \
  -args '{"base_url":"http://localhost:3000","executable":"id"}' \
  -output cve-2025-55182.approved

# Finally, execute the plugin (Harness)
./bin/harness \
  -file cve-2025-55182.approved \
  -harness-keystore-key "harness-key" \
  -target-key target_public.pem \
  -exploit-key exploit_public.pem
```

## Arguments

- `base_url` (required): The base URL of the target Next.js or React.js application
- `executable` (optional): The command to execute on the target system (defaults to `echo HARNESS_<random_number>` for vulnerability testing)

## How It Works

This plugin exploits a prototype pollution vulnerability in Next.js and React.js by:

1. Crafting a malicious chunk that pollutes the prototype chain
2. Sending a POST request with multipart form data containing the crafted payload
3. The payload triggers command execution through Next.js's internal handling of form data
4. Returns the HTTP status code and response body

## Security Note

This plugin is for authorized security testing only. Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
